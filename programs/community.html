        <p><strong>Commissioned Shows</strong></p>
           
        <p>Over the years, Child’s Play has created commissioned shows for various sponsors.  Commissioned shows can be made to order</p>

        <p><img id="img3" src="/Images/programs/Perrykids.jpg"   alt="wicp">At Microsoft, we created a writing contest with the specific theme of illustrating the benefits of a website.  At Target, we created a program to coincide with their Honor Your Teacher project.  And, at Kraft Foods, we developed a multi-year program, working with them as an Arts Partner for over five years.</p>
        <p>The Bushnell Theatre in Hartford, Connecticut commissioned us year after year to create a show based on the “world premiere” writings of their local children for their Language Arts Festival.  Similarly, for the Westport Country Playhouse in Westport, Connecticut, we developed a production called Something of Our Own, showcasing writings from children in their community.</p>
        <p>Commissioned shows bring benefits to both Child’s Play and our partners and are a win/win.</p>
            
        <div class="backShade1">  <br>
        <p><strong>Chicago Young Writers Program (CYWP)</strong><p>CYWP is our principal outreach program. We aim to motivate Chicago Public School students to write, and to provide teachers with drama-based methods for writing instruction. Our focus is primarily on schools whose children are educationally at risk.

        <p>By exciting children about their own abilities as creative individuals, we work to raise self-esteem and motivate young people to embrace education, reaping the life-long benefits that a love of learning creates.</p>

        <p>We identify and encourage young writers by performing the best of their stories and poems, and award Certificates of Creativity to works worthy of honorable mention. Since 1985, we have provided free and reduced-fee performance and educational workshops for hundreds of thousands of students throughout the city. The program reaches about 10,000 students in Chicago annually.<br><br></p>
            </div>
            
        <p><strong>Theatre Company In Residence</strong></p>
        <p>Child’s Play has worked with community organizations to develop cohesive programs that address community needs and bring people together.  For instance, we were once commissioned to bring resident seniors in an area to tell their life stories to children in the schools.  The children then created vignettes based on those stories and performed them on the stage. There were several stakeholders involved in this process and we worked with each of them to make the program a success.  We can do the same for you. </p>

        <p>An option may be to develop a program serving all the schools in your district.   Child’s Play worked with all ten schools in the district of Rock Island, IL through a relationship with their Arts Council.  We held writing classes in the schools during the day, and ended the program at the end of the week with a family show.  After school programs are also a service we provide, along with professional development so programs can carry on after we’ve gone.</p>

        <p>Our company has extensive experience collaborating with like-minded organizations such as museums, art galleries, civic groups, and other non-profits, with a strong focus on achieving shared goals. We’ve helped gain projects exposure through local media.  And, we’ve received numerous awards and recognition for the work we’ve done.</p>
