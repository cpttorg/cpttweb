                <p><strong>Writing Is...Child's Play! - Group Generated Stories</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Child's Play actors perform outstanding examples of children's writing using an improvisation type of generated stories. Students and actors perform together, and we can use school themes or curriculum that the educators want to the student to learn.  For example some of the programs used were drug and smoking prevention (Commission Show), Violence awareness (Peace by Piece) and recycling (The Great Green Adventures of Rman and Earth Kid) and conservation (Global Energy).
                    
                    
                   <!-- Child's Play actors perform outstanding examples of children's writing using an improve type of generated stories. Student and actor perform togther and we can use school themes or curuculum that the teacher want to conveye to the audiance.

Next, students brainstorm with the actors to generate ideas using one of our many effective tools for helping young authors organize their thoughts. <br><br>Children are then active participants in creating a group generated story. The story is brought to life as a play, using our actors and the students as performers.<br><br></p>   -->

                <p>As described in the witting master class, Child's Play actors perform examples of children's writing in a fun, fast-paced presentation demonstrating the limitless subject matter available. Next, students brainstorm with the actors to generate ideas using one of our many effective tools for helping young authors organize their thoughts. Children are then active participants in creating a group generated story. The story is brought to life as a play, using our actors and the students as performers.<br><br></p>

                <h2>Classroom Visits (optional)</h2>

                <p>To enhance the "Writing is...Child's Play!" master class, company artists can also conduct follow-up instruction in individual classrooms. These classroom visits further develop concepts presented in the master class and introduce new writing tools. During the course of a single classroom visit, students put pen to paper and write the beginning of their own story and become active participants in the creation of a group generated story, which they then act out using our actors and their teachers as performers.</p> 

                <p><strong>New Voices</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Full Productions wrtten by Students<br></strong><br>
                <img id="vpimg1" src="/Images/school/certificates_authenticity.jpg"   alt="School Photo">The "Writing is…Child’s Play!" master class is also the perfect kick-off for a "New Voices" show - the most exciting aspect of the Child's Play program. A "New Voices" show features stories and poems written by students following the master class, that are then submitted to Child's Play for consideration.  A selection of stories from these submissions is then performed in a full production with costumes, props and sets by our professional actors upon a return visit. <br><br>Certificates of Creativity are awarded to students whose writings are selected for presentation and to those receiving honorable mention.<br></p><br>

                Child’s Play also conducts hands-on drama workshops that use theater improvisation games to inspire creative expression. This workshop introduces the three actor tools. From breathing properly to articulating, young actors learn how to develop a stage voice.<br><br>

                From basic movements to mime, they become confident physical performers. Through fun improvisation games, their creativity is inspired and harnessed to become a part of a group “ensemble”. This class serves as a fantastic first introduction to performance. <br>
                <p>Story adaptation – “From Page to Stage” - workshops are also available.<br><br></p>
