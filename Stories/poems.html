    <h3>AARON NULL'S POEM, 
      Aaron, 
      Grade,  2
      Central School,
        Roxana, IL</h3>
    <h5>I  have a dog.<br>
      I  have a cat.<br>
      I  like them both.<br>
    And  that is that.</h5>
    
    <h3>ANIMAL  CRACKERS, 
      Rachel,
      Grade 3, 
        Walt Whitman School </h3>
    <h5>I was eating lunch with Monica,  Erin, and Laura.<br>
      We opened our lunch boxes.&nbsp; We started to eat.<br>
      I had a sandwich and fruit.<br>
      All of a sudden I saw something  wrapped in foil.<br>
      I opened it up.<br>
      It was a box of animal  crackers.&nbsp; <br>
      Chocolate animal crackers.<br>
      All of the sudden an animal cracker  jumped out of the box!<br>
      It started to dance.<br>
      She asked of I wanted to dance.<br>
      I said yes. <br>
      We started to dance.<br>
      The teacher came in.<br>
      The animal changed into a cracker  again.<br>
      I was dancing on the table.<br>
      I got in trouble.<br>
    That was the best day of my life!</h5>
    
    <h3>ANGER,
        Dawn,
      Grade 7,
      Mahopec Falls, NY</h3>
    <h5>Anger  is a huge beast<br>
      It  changes form with each moment<br>
      And  lives off our emotions.<br>
      It's  roar is like that of the devil.<br>
      It is  truly evil.<br>
      Each  moment you get angrier,<br>
    it  gets much stronger.</h5>
    
    <h3>ANT  IN THE KITCHEN,
      Karen </h3>
    <h5>Ant,  and, why are you so cruel<br>
      Running  around disobeying every rule?<br>
      You  crawl around and steal<br>
    Food  that we bought to have a pleasant meal.</h5>
    <h5>Ant,  and, sneaky bad ant!<br>
      Why  do you do the things that you do?<br>
      Why  do you invade our cereal box?<br>
      You  should be climbing on rocks!</h5>
    <h5>Ant,  ant. I hope you can hear me,<br>
      I  certainly hope you fear me.<br>
      Now  you're walking on a can of trash.<br>
      SMASH!</h5>
    
    <h3>APPLIANCES,
      by  Faiz,
      St.  Scholastica School,
      Woodridge, IL</h3>
    <h5>Dear  Companies,</h5>
    <h5>Your  new electric tooth brush<br>
      destroyed  ma's upper plate.</h5>
    <h5>Your  new electric blanket<br>
      ignited  Uncle Nate.</h5>
    <h5>Your  new electreic blender <br>
      won't  let go of little Sue.</h5>
    <h5>Each  and every single day<br>
      We find out new things appliances can do.</h5>
    <h5>The  more hatred you show, the more it possesses<br>
    you.</h5>
    <h5>It's  arms reach out and grab you.<br>
      When  you least expect it, it takes hold of you.<br>
      It  captures your sense of judgment,<br>
      and  destroys your inhibitions.<br>
      It  causes you to lose your temper,<br>
    and  your close friends too.</h5>
    
    <h3>THE  AWAKENING BLACK CAT, 
      Rochelle,
      Waukegan, IL</h3>
    <h5>The  cat yawns<br>
      Opens  her jaws.<br>
      Stretches  her legs<br>
      And  shows her claws.<br>
      Then  she gets up<br>
      Stands  on all four<br>
      Long  stiff legs<br>
    And  yawns some more.</h5>
    
    <h3>A  WORLD TURNED INSIDE OUT,
      Grace  Ann Keene,
      grade  8,
      Family  Learning Academies,
      Harrington, DE</h3>
    <h5>Up is  where we have to go,<br>
      To go  away from down.<br>
      But  what if every thing were turned<br>
    The  other way around?</h5>
    <h5>Floors  would then be our ceilings,<br>
      And  ceilings would be our floors.<br>
      But  would we go down the stairs,<br>
      To go  through attic doors?</h5>
    <h5>Sitting  down would seem quite strange,<br>
      And  standing up would too.<br>
      And  would the birds go underground<br>
      If up  is where they flew?</h5>
    <h5>What  would saying “bottom” mean?<br>
      Would  mountains still have tops?<br>
      Would  rabbits, frogs, and kangaroos<br>
      Have  trouble with their hops?</h5>
    <h5>Falling  down I do a lot.<br>
      Would  falling up hurt less?<br>
      If up  were down would spilling milk<br>
      Produce  a smaller mess?</h5>
    <h5>All  these things I’m wondering<br>
      Are  silly, without a doubt.<br>
      But  how do you suppose we’d feel<br>
      With  things turned inside out?</h5>
    
    <h3>BUTTERFLY,
      Kevin,
      4th  Grade,
      Virdin School</h3>
    <h5>Once  when I was little<br>
      I  found a butterfly<br>
      Stuck  in the hot tar<br>
    of  the road.</h5>
    <h5>Being  very careful'<br>
      Not  to hurt it<br>
      I  picked it up <br>
      And  put it in a box<br>
      overnight.</h5>
    <h5>The  next morning <br>
      I let  it go.</h5>
    <h5>Two  days later <br>
      He  flew back to me.</h5>
    <h5>I  guess it was because<br>
      I was  nice to him.</h5>
    
    <h3>THE CHICAGO BLUES,
      By: Taylor,
      Grade 3,
      Francis Xavier Ward School, 
        Chicago</h3>
    <h5>The  train underground<br>
      Up on  town anywhere<br>
      they  keep moving<br>
      All  the way where the<br>
      big  band plays<br>
    Chicago is so groovy!!</h5>
    
    <h3>THE CHRISTMAS SEASON,
      By Sarah,
      Fifth Grade, Hillis Elementary</h3>
    <h5>Snow falling gently, there’s caroling tonight<br>
      Children are singing in soft candlelight<br>
      Gathering together with those whom we love<br>
      Watching the snow fall as white as a dove<br>
      Hot apple cider, cheeks red as a rose<br>
      Packages wrapped in bright paper and bows<br>
      Look at the snow falling gracefully down<br>
      And mother in her white flowing gown<br>
      Dad’s in the kitchen fixing the tv<br>
      I’m wrapping presents for under the tree<br>
      I’m filled with excitement, happiness, and joy<br>
    For it soon will be Christmas Day.</h5>
    
    <h3>THE  DENTIST'S OFFICE,
      Evanston, IL</h3>
    <h5>Sitting  in the dentist's office<br>
      Waiting  for your turn.<br>
      There's  not much to do<br>
      But  to stare at a fern.<br>
      Did I  brush my teeth today?<br>
  "Good  checkup" will he say?<br>
      Will  I get a filling?<br>
      I  hate the sound of drilling!<br>
      I'd  rather be home playing.<br>
      What's  that the nurse is saying?<br>
    Uh,  oh!&nbsp; It's my turn.</h5>
    
    <h3>DINOSAURS BECAME EXTINCT,
      Iba, Grade 2,
      Herndon, VA,</h3>
    <h5>Dinosaurs were terrible lizards.<br>
      We don't know how they died,<br>
    But we think it was a blizzard!</h5>
    
    <h3>THE  DINOSAUR MIX-UP,
      Allysha,
      Grade  1,
      Reading, PA</h3>
    <h5>Five  dinosaurs ate my birthday cake<br>
    After  that they had a tummy ache.</h5>
    <h5>Then  those dinosaurs wanted some more<br>
      So  they ate my bedroom door.</h5>
    <h5>There  was Tyrannosaurus Rex and Allosaurus too<br>
      An  Apatasuarus in my closet laid an egg in my shoe.</h5>
    <h5>All  five dinosaurs got together think<br>
      Then  a Stegosaurus washed his face in my sink</h5>
    <h5>I  entered the room and saw all the mess<br>
      I  started to clean - a Ptereadactyl did the rest.</h5>
    <h5>How  would I get them out of my room?<br>
      I  couldn't use a dust mop or a broom.</h5>
    <h5>Oh no  I thought - how will my parents feel?<br>
      Then  the Tyrannosaurus Rex ate them all for his meal.</h5>
    
    <h3>EMORY,
      By Cort,
      Clive Elementary,
      Mrs. Beaman,
      4th grade</h3>
    <h5>My sister has almost no hair.<br>
      She whines all the time.<br>
      She is 18 months old.<br>
      She makes my room a pit.<br>
      When I take some thing from her <br>
      She whines up a storm.<br>
      My sister whines because she doesn’t<br>
      Get her way.<br>
      I love my little sister but when she<br>
      Whines I get very mad at her and I get <br>
      Really annoyed.<br>
      She is fun to play with out doors,<br>
    When she is in a good mood.</h5>
    
    <h3>FALLING UP.
      Daniel,
      2nd grade, Pleasantville, NY</h3>
    <h5>I’m falling up, I’m falling down, I’m falling left and  right.<br>
      I’m simply falling out of sight.<br>
      It’s very scary, yes indeed,<br>
      I have no idea what I’ll need.<br>
    I’m falling up, I’m falling down, I’m falling all around.</h5>
    
    <h3>GHOSTS AND GOBLINS,
    Adam,
    West Des Moines School</h3>
    <h5>Ghost and Goblin  at your host<br>
      Now they have to make a roast.<br>
      They made the roast until they roast the host.<br>

    Forever and ever until they wake.</h5>

    <h3>THE  GRUMPY GHOST,
      Brandy,
      Sheffield School,
      Grade  3,
      Lynchburgh, VA</h3>
    <h5>My  monster is a grumpy Ghost.<br>
      He  likes to scare the children<br>
      He  lives in an old, old house.<br>
      He  has no friends.<br>
      He  likes to fly in the dark.<br>
      He  does not like to eat.<br>
      On  Halloween he likes to hide in the bushes.<br>
    When the children walk by, he likes to jump out and frighten  them.</h5>
    
    <h3>HEBREW,
      Freya,
      Armonk, NY</h3>
    <h5>Hebrew  is a language<br>
      A  special one, its true.<br>
      All  the things you say in English<br>
    You  can say in Hebrew, too.</h5>
    <h5>One  well know Hebrew word, Shalom,<br>
      Is  three words all in one.<br>
      It  means hello, good-bye and peace.<br>
      Learning  Hebrew can be fun.</h5>
    
    <h3>HOW THE DINOSAUR BECAME EXTINCT,
      Jame, Grade 7,
      Dirksen School, Chicago</h3>
    <h5>A dinosaur is a huge reptile<br>
      with such a little brain,<br>
      That if you made them identify themselves<br>
    they would always forget their name.</h5>
    <h5>They lived on Earth many years ago<br>
      and they went through many seasons.<br>
      They would always seem to make it through,<br>
      it didn't matter what was the reason.</h5>
    <h5>And then, one night, when they all slept<br>
      not knowing death was on the way,<br>
      A meteor came and blocked <br>
      the sun's beautiful bright red rays.</h5>
    <h5>And then there was no food to eat<br>
      and the water wasn't fit to drink,<br>
      And that, my friends, is the story<br>
      on how the dinosaur became  extinct.</h5>
    
    <h3>HOW TO CLEAN YOUR ROOM,
      Kim,
      Mt. Sinai School,
      Mt. Sinai, NY,
      5/29/86</h3>
    <h5>The first thing to do is to keep the  door of our room closed so your mother can't see how messy it is.<br>
      If that works you don't have to read  the rest.<br>
      But if she does see it, this is what  you do.<br>
      First, you find all the garbage in  your room and throw it in the garbage.<br>
      Second, you empty your garbage pail  because it will be overflowing by now.<br>
      Now you pick up all your clothes off  the floor and put them in the hamper.<br>
      Don't take all the time to look and  see what is dirty or clean, it's probable filthy since it was on your floor.<br>
      After that you stash as much as you  can under the bed where your mother can't see it.<br>
      Next, the remaining junk you throw  in your drawers since they're probably empty because everything is in the  hamper.<br>
      One of the biggest tasks is making  your bed.&nbsp; <br>
      You have to make it or else your  mother will see all your junk under there.<br>
      You have to make the bed so the  blankets go down to the floor.<br>
      Throw you pillow on the bed and  you're finished!<br>
      Enjoy you nice clean room while it  lasts.<br>
    And please make you bed every  morning or you will have to go through the process again.</h5>
    
    <h3>THE HUMAN BODY,
      Lucy,
      Grade  2,
      Miss  Carlisle,
      Roaring Brook School,
      Chappaqua, NY</h3>
    <h5>The  human body has more than 200 bones.<br>
      Your  head is called the skull.<br>
      The  scientific name is the cranium.<br>
      Your  ribcage protects your heart, your lungs, and other organs.<br>
      We  have a lot of cells.<br>
      The  cells eat basic foods like fat, starches, and sugar.<br>
      The  cells burn it up.<br>
      The  waste food goes down to the little kidney.<br>
      Then  it goes farther.<br>
    And finally out.</h5>
    
    <h3>I SAW  A BUTTERFLY,
      Gudrun,
      Grade 5,
      Champaign, IL</h3>
    <h5>I saw  a butterfly <br>
      With  its silvery wings<br>
      As it  swooped and soared <br>
      Through  the bright blue sky.<br>
      Then  I thought that I too<br>
      Must  feel the wind on my wings<br>
      And  freedom<br>
    As  does a butterfly.</h5>
    
    <h3>I  WONDER,
      By: Molly ,
      age 9, Grade 4,
      Anderson School,
      St. Charles, IL</h3>
    <h5>When  I look up in the big sky, I see the stars that make me cry.<br>
      Then  I see the grass down low, I think of things I like to know.<br>
      I  wonder why the stars are bright, and why they come out during night.<br>
      I  wonder what’s down in the ground, if there’s something that can’t be found.<br>
    Now my thoughts are out of my head, I will lay here in my  warm bed</h5>
    
    <h3>LITTLE MISS QUIET,
      By Shelby </h3>
    <h5>Little Miss Quiet<br>
      Always started a riot<br>
      For she was very different you see<br>
      Always had been<br>
      Had nothing to say<br>
    But she was sweet as a sweet honeybee.</h5>
    <h5>In the morning she’d wake up and stretch<br>
      And hop quickly out of her bed<br>
      Her mother would yell, at the top of her lungs<br>
      “Wake up, quiet sleepyhead!”</h5>
    <h5>She’d sit at the table<br>
      And eat breakfast quite fast<br>
      Yet no matter what<br>
      She always seemed to be last.</h5>
    <h5>She’d sit at her desk<br>
      Never raising her hand<br>
      Her voice never heard <br>
      In the choir or band.</h5>
    <h5>At the end of the day<br>
      She skipped out of class<br>
      Her feet gliding smoothly<br>
      As if walking on glass.</h5>
    <h5>She’s come home and sit<br>
      On the edge of her bed<br>
      “What are you doing?” mom yelled,<br>
      Her face turned bright red –<br>
      As a box slowly was slipped<br>
      under her bed.</h5>
    <h5>She said Grace at dinner<br>
      And bowed down her head<br>
      Then came the part <br>
      That she truly did dread<br>
      “Dear, how was school?”<br>
      Her mother would say<br>
      As Little Miss Quiet<br>
      Closed her eyes to pray.&nbsp; </h5>
    <h5>Then she would whisper,<br>
      “There’s nothing to say.”<br>
      And close her eyes tighter<br>
      Hoping they’d all go away.</h5>
    <h5>“Just a normal day?” mom would ask<br>
      “Nothing good? Nothing bad?”<br>
      The sheer thought of talking<br>
      Just made Little Miss Quiet so sad.</h5>
    <h5>Then finally she opened<br>
      Her eyes up quite wide<br>
      Her family just looked<br>
      At her in surprise</h5>
    <h5>She opened her mouth <br>
      And twirled her curly locks<br>
      “Happy Mother’s Day,” she whispered<br>
      As she held out a box.</h5>
    <h5>Mom looked inside <br>
      And to her delight!<br>
      An all “A” report card!<br>
      Little Miss Quiet was bright!</h5>
    <h5>She may have been quiet<br>
      With no much to say<br>
      But now everyone knew<br>
      She’d make a difference someday!<br>
      THE END</h5>

    <h3>ME, A  SCIENTIST,
      Alex,
      George Washington School,
      Grade  5</h3>
    <h5>Science  is a fun thing to do.<br>
      If I  were a scientist I would try to discover many things.<br>
      Scientists  are important in our life.<br>
      If  the scientists never found the dinosaur bones, we would never see how big the  dinosaurs are.&nbsp; <br>
      We  would never be able to read about dinosaurs.<br>
      We  would not even know what their names are of mean.<br>
      Scientists  in the future will find out how to stop all the animals from dying, the water  from being poisoned, the air from being polluted.&nbsp; <br>
    This country will not be as bad as it is now.</h5>

    <h5>A  scientist!<br>
      Yes,  a scientist!<br>
      I'd  be the very best one.<br>
      Not  even Einstein could top me with his E=MC2.<br>
      Oh,  if I were a scientist today I would create a world for play.<br>
      A  world for jobs, a world with door knobs,<br>
      so  you can go to any place, time, or day.,<br>
      The  world is said to be round.<br>
      I can  make it a square or a triangle.<br>
      A  tree on a corner, a mountain on its edge.<br>
      I can  create a dust muncher so you don't have to use pledge.<br>
    The world would be perfect, thanks to me - the scientist!</h5>

    <h3>NAPPY HAIR DAY,
      By: Candace  Harrington, Joshua Hughes, Jeremy Martin</h3>
    <h5>On Nappy Hair Day  you don’t comb or brush your hair all day.<br>
      On this day we give  each other nappy hair names.<br>
      We relax all day  talking about how nappy our hair is.<br>
    Then at midnight we  comb and brush our hair and the holiday officially ends.</h5>
    <h5>I hate when I get a  hair cut<br>
      I hate when I get a  perm<br>
      But I am still  happy with my very <br>
      Nappy hair<br>
      The gel doesn’t  take<br>
      All my combs break<br>
      But I am still  happy with my very <br>
      Nappy hair<br>
      Being nappy makes  me happy</h5>
    
    <h3>THE  OUTSIDE LOOKING IN,
      Ian, grade 6,
      Family Learning Academy, Dover, DE</h3>
    <h5>They  say that we are dangerous<br>
      They  say that we are mean<br>
      But  monsters have a harder life<br>
    than  you could ever dream</h5>
    <h5>They  say that we are ugly<br>
      They  say we’re one big sin<br>
      But  all we really are is<br>
      on  the outside looking in</h5>
    <h5>Being  on the outside looking in<br>
      is  the hardest thing to do<br>
      never  fitting in<br>
      and  always feeling blue</h5>
    <h5>For  all the monsters out there<br>
      you  have a friend in me<br>
      So  don’t worry, be happy<br>

    <h3>THE  PRINCESS,
      By  Joanna,

      Chicago, IL</h3>
    <h5>She  is thought a little beggar girl,<br>
      Beragged,  homeless orphan.<br>
      She  has no clothing but a pitiful frock,<br>
      She  has no possession but her pride.<br>
      The  people pass by her as she sits in a doorway,<br>
      Hoping  for a crumb to eat.<br>
      They  do not see how tall she sits.<br>
      They  do not notice the way she holds her head high.<br>
      They  do not recognize the royal gleam in her eyes.<br>
      They  do not know that the little beggar girl<br>
    Is a  true princess of her own little kingdom.</h5>
    
    <h3>THE  RACE,
      Thressa,
      Grade 8,
      Ruggles School,
      Chicago</h3>
    <h5>One  day the Hot Water and Cold Water were having an argument.<br>
      The  Hot Water thought that molecules could move faster in it,<br>
      and  the Cold Water thought that molecules could move faster in it.<br>
      So  they set a date for a race.<br>
      Sugar  agreed to help determine the race.<br>
      On  the day of the race, Salt and Pepper were judges.<br>
      When  everyone arrived, Salt put exactly two tablespoon of sugar into Hot and Cold.<br>
      Then  Pepper stirred both.<br>
      And  to everyone's surprise the Sugar dissolved first in the Hot.<br>
      So  Hot Water won the bet.<br>
      That means that Hot Water was right and everyone thought  that was <br>
    always wrong because he also got hot under the collar.</h5>
    
    <h3>RAINDROPS,
      Megan,
      Grade 1,
      Barrington, IL</h3>
    <h5>Raindrops  are such funny things.<br>
      They  haven't feet and haven't wings.<br>
      Yet  they sail through the air<br>
      with  the greatest of ease,<br>
      And  dance up and down the street<br>
    where  they please.</h5>

      Danielle,
      Grade  6,
      Chicago, IL</h3>
    <h5>As I  walked through the darkness,<br>
      I was  given quite a fright <br>
      by a  strange misty shadow<br>
    lurking  in the night.</h5>
    <h5>I  felt scared as a kitten<br>
      and I  was hoping for day,<br>
      the  shadow was a lion<br>
      and I  was its prey.</h5>
    <h5>My  screams pierced the air<br>
      my  skin went deathly pale,<br>
      the  shadow crept towards me<br>
      with  its dark misty veil.</h5>
    <h5>Mortal  terror seized my heart<br>
      but I  stood my ground and said,<br>
  "I  fear you not mysterious beast" <br>
      and  to my surprise it fled.</h5>
    <h5>To  this day I know not why<br>
      the  shadow did appear,<br>
      but I  am almost certain<br>
      it  was created by my fear.</h5>

      There’s even show in your hair.<br>
      Wind blows cold, way too cold,<br>
      And Mr. Winter is getting old.<br>
      I think in my head is it snowing anywhere?<br>
      Now it’s time for the fair,<br>
      And it’s still snowing everywhere.<br>
      It snowed for far too long,<br>
      And I feel like I don’t belong.<br>
      Trees are covered branch to trunk,<br>
      My friends and I, we feel stuck.<br>
      The snow looks all fluffy,<br>
      And my cheeks are all puffy.<br>
      My nose is still all stuffy.<br>
      I still think in my head…..<br>
    I believe it’s snowing in my bed!?!</h5>

      Write a poem about a man whose nose is twelve feet long.<br>

      And your tears suddenly dry<br>

    <h3>THE TIME HAS COME,
      Scott,
      South Salem, NY</h3>
    <h5>The  time has come to collect the rent<br>
      And  this time I mean every cent.<br>
      The  house it was quite a wreck<br>
      But I  decided what the heck.<br>
      I  fixed it up, made it neat<br>
      Now  collecting rent is quite a treat.<br>
      I'll  save my pennies from the rent.<br>
      Not  one little bit will be spent.<br>
      I'll  find a house that's dirty and cheap<br>
      And  fix it up with out a peep<br>
      I'll  work all day, won't stop to play<br>
      And  rent this next house some other day.<br>

    <h3>WHALES,
      (Animal Tales and Dinosaur Scales),
      Ellen, Grade 4,
      Huntington, NY</h3>
    <h5>What’s that out at sea <br>
      Like a ship with no sail?<br>
      The chances are good<br>
      What you see is a whale.<br>
      And where there is one<br>
      There are two,<br>
      Maybe twenty,<br>
      For whales enjoy whales<br>
    And of friends they have plenty.</h5>
    <h5>They slide through the water<br>
      With the greatest of ease,<br>
      And like sleek submarines<br>
      They descend when they please.<br>
      They rise to the surface,<br>
      They spout and they spray,<br>
      And then down they dive<br>
      Up and down<br>
      All the day.</h5>
    <h5>There’s no trouble with traffic,<br>
      No stoplights of red.<br>
      A whale can keep swimming<br>
      For hours straight ahead.</h5>
    <h5>And when it grows tired<br>
      Does he seek out a nest?<br>
      A hole<br>
      Or a cave<br>
      Or a house<br>
      There to rest?<br>
      No, wherever he is, he just stops there and naps,<br>
      Rocked to sleep by the roll of the ocean, perhaps.</h5>
    <h5>A whale may swim, 
      A whale may swish,,
      But it isn’t, it isn’t,
      It isn’t a fish.</h5>
