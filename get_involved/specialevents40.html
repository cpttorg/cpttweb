           Here is what Gigi said, <em>"This wonderful song was created by Doug B Smith, an early Child's Play Touring Theatre cast member and musical Director. This is Child's Play Touring Theatre 40th Anniversary Highlight Reel. I was so fortunate to be a founding member of this amazing Children's theatre company Created by Victor and June Podasgrosi. The roots of my training came from Child's Play and the brilliant direction of Victor cptt.org/ (773) 235-8911<br><br>
           Child's Play Touring Theatre Founded in 1978, Child's Play Touring Theatre was the first theatre company to realize the value of children's own writing and perform exclusively stories and poems written by young authors. Combining the important, imaginative writings of children with the craftsmanship of professional theatre artists and educators, they created a unique stage where children's voices can be heard, examined and treasured.<br><br>
           A nationally recognized, 501(c )3 not-for-profit organization, they inspire young people to read, write and think creatively. The goal at Child's Play is to help children understand the value and significance that writing and reading has on their lives. Their performances and workshops offer a powerful teaching tool that strengthens and enhances the teaching and learning process. Many of the songs were composed from children's original poems by 30 Rocks Writer and former Childs Play Cast Member Jeff Richmond including Child's Plays Theme song "Write a Story" which was co written by Michael Thomas. Another well known Child's Play Writer in Residence was SNL and 30 Rock performer and writer Tina Fey.<br><br>
           Over the years, Child's Play has developed multiple partnerships with other arts education organizations to bring enhanced arts curricula to schools and communities throughout the United States. To date, we have reached over 4.5 million children, educators and adults through workshops residencies, after school programs, and summer camps and have performed the original works of over 20,000 young writers."</em></p>
